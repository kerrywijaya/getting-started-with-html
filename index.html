<P>
There are five aspects of the way in which programmers think:
</p>

<p>
<b>procedural thinking</b>
<br>..means giving unambiguous instructions to the computer. <br>It also means approaching the solution of a problem step by step. <br>Procedural thinking is based on..
<br><b>technolochigal empathy</b>
<br>,which is basically the assumption that <em>computers are stupid</em> :b
<br><b>abstract thinking</b>
<br>..means finding generality amongst things that are seemingly different.
<br><b>systems thinking</b>
<br>..is breaking a problem down into smaller pieces, so it's similar to procedural thinking (<em>there - I found a generality!</em>)
<br><b>debugging</b>
<br>..is the process of finding and fixing mistakes. You have to ask yourself the following questions:
<br>- where's the bug?
<br>- what has caused the bug?
<br>- how can I fix it?
</p>
<P>
...now I can't wait to learn more of that stuff!!
